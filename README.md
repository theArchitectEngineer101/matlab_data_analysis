# 📊 MATLAB Data Analysis & Engineering Projects

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my MATLAB scripts and projects, focusing on data analysis, systems simulation, and engineering visualization. Each sub-project is contained within its own directory and includes a dedicated README file with specific details.

The main goal is to provide practical, well-documented tools and examples to explore various engineering concepts.

## 📁 Project Index
